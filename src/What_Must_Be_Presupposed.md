# What Must Be Presupposed?

## Purpose / Key Focus
Introduce the idea that all knowing rests on unprovable, starting points defined by teleological unity (e.g. intelligibility, unity, being)

## Corresponds to Stage
Unconditioned Source of Purpose

## How It Is Ordered

This list follows a teleological and epistemic sequence. Each level presupposes the one upstream. Knowledge is not constructed from the bottom up like a pile of facts—it flows from prior commitments into structured understanding and lived expression.

### Epistemic Sequence

### Summary Table

| Level   | Name                  | Description                                        | Core Assumption (Upstream Prior)                                           |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🜂 1    | **Unconditioned Source of Purpose**  | The ground of all intelligibility, telos and meaning. Final goal and first mover.        | All knowing presupposes a given origin that is not derived. Knowing has Conscience.                |
| 🜁 2    | **Intrinsic Patterning**  | Reality is structured with discoverable order and purpose.        | Meaning is embedded and embodied in things, not projected onto them.                     |
| 🜃 3    | **Participatory Knowing** | Understanding arises through engaged relationship.    | Knowledge involves presence and transformation.                             |
| 🜄 4    | **Right Discernment**     | Reason must align with upstream orientation.          | Logic is governed by purpose and moral proportion.                          |
| 🧠 5    | **Mental Formation**      | Perception is filtered through inner habits.          | What we notice depends on how we have been shaped.                          |
| 📊 6    | **Empirical Perception**  | Observations are always interpreted within a frame.   | Data presupposes intelligibility, structure, and meaning.                   |
| 💬 7    | **Wisdom-in-Action**      | Knowledge matures through lived coherence.            | Truth is not static—it must be enacted to be fulfilled.                     |
| 🧬 8    | **Inherited Formation**   | Thought is shaped by memory, tradition, and trust.    | We interpret the world through what we have received.                       |
