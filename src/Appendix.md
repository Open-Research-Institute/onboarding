| 🜂 1    | **Unconditioned Source**  | The ground of all intelligibility and meaning.        | All knowing presupposes a given origin that is not derived.                 |
| 🜁 2    | **Intrinsic Patterning**  | Reality is structured with discoverable order.        | Meaning is embedded in things, not projected onto them.                     |
| 🜃 3    | **Participatory Knowing** | Understanding arises through engaged relationship.    | Knowledge involves presence and transformation.                             |
| 🜄 4    | **Right Discernment**     | Reason must align with upstream orientation.          | Logic is governed by purpose and moral proportion.                          |
| 🧠 5    | **Mental Formation**      | Perception is filtered through inner habits.          | What we notice depends on how we have been shaped.                          |
| 📊 6    | **Empirical Perception**  | Observations are always interpreted within a frame.   | Data presupposes intelligibility, structure, and meaning.                   |
| 💬 7    | **Wisdom-in-Action**      | Knowledge matures through lived coherence.            | Truth is not static—it must be enacted to be fulfilled.                     |
| 🧬 8    | **Inherited Formation**   | Thought is shaped by memory, tradition, and trust.    | We interpret the world through what we have received.                       |
